This Was my first project in c++ 
LOL!!
In this project, I developed a straightforward University Admission Management System using C++. 
This application was created during my first semester at the University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore.
This C++ program is a student management system that allows users to manage student data, including adding, updating, deleting, and viewing student records. It also enables the calculation of student aggregates based on marks from different subjects (Matric, FSc, and ECAT). The program supports multiple user accounts with login and signup functionalities, and the data is stored in text files for persistence. Users can add preferences for each student and the system calculates their aggregate score based on the entered marks. The program ensures that the data is saved and loaded correctly from files upon startup and exit.
